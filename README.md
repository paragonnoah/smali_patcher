# Smali Patcher 

## Overview
This script is a Python-based tool designed to modify and bypass various security restrictions in Android applications by manipulating Smali code. It modifies specific Smali files to disable detection mechanisms related to VPN, proxy, emulator, Frida, and screen restrictions.

## Features
- Bypasses anti-debugging mechanisms.
- Blocks `System.exit` and `Process.killProcess` calls.
- Modifies Smali files to bypass anti-screen restrictions.
- Disables emulator detection.
- Bypasses Frida detection.
- Disables VPN/Proxy detection mechanisms.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Smali/Baksmali toolset (for decompiling and recompiling APKs)

## Usage
1. Clone or download the script.
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
3. Run the script using the command:
   ```bash
   python3 script_name.py <path_to_smali_files>
   ```
   Replace `<path_to_smali_files>` with the directory containing the extracted Smali files.
4. The script will scan and modify the Smali files automatically.

## Output
- The script displays messages indicating which detections have been bypassed.
- The modified Smali files are saved in the same directory.

## Notes
- Always test the modified APK on a sandboxed environment before deploying.
- Some modifications may cause unexpected behavior if not handled properly.
